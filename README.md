## Why

Figma is a closed platform that actively fights programmatic access. In February 2026, [Figma 126.1.2 started stripping `--remote-debugging-port`](https://forum.figma.com/report-a-problem-6/remote-debugging-port-not-working-in-figma-desktop-126-1-2-50858) on startup — killing CDP-based automation tools like [figma-use](https://github.com/dannote/figma-use) that filled gaps Figma refused to address. Their own MCP server, launched months after figma-use proved the demand, still can't create or modify designs — it's read-only.

This is a supply chain problem. Designers and developers build workflows on top of their design tool. When that tool is closed-source, the vendor controls what's possible. They can break your tooling overnight with a point release. Your design files are in a proprietary binary format that only their software can fully read.

Coding tools went through the same shift. VS Code opened the editor. LLMs opened code generation. Projects like [pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) opened the AI coding agent. Design tools are next.

OpenPencil is:

- **Open source** — MIT license, read and modify everything
- **Figma-compatible** — opens .fig files natively, copy/paste between apps
- **AI-native** — built-in chat with tool use, bring your own API key, no vendor lock-in
- **Free forever** — no account, no subscription, no internet required, ~5 MB install
- **Programmable** — headless CLI, every operation is scriptable

Your design files are yours. Your tools should be too.

## Features

- **Figma .fig file import** — open native Figma files directly
- **Figma clipboard** — copy/paste between OpenPencil and Figma
- **Real-time collaboration** — P2P via WebRTC, no server required. Share a link, co-edit live with cursors and presence
- **Vector networks** — complex boolean shapes and open paths, like Figma
- **Auto-layout** — constraint-based layout matching Figma behavior
- **Components & instances** — with live sync, overrides, component sets
- **Pen tool** — bezier curves with tangent handles
- **Inline text editing** — multi-line text with system fonts
- **Image export** — PNG, JPG, WEBP at any scale
- **Headless CLI** — inspect, search, and render .fig files without a GUI
- **Undo/redo** — all operations are undoable
- **Snap guides** — edge and center snapping
- **Color picker** — HSV, hue/alpha sliders, hex input, gradients
- **~5 MB install, works fully offline** — no account, no server, no internet required

## Getting Started

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Collaboration

Share a link to co-edit in real time. No server, no account — peers connect directly via WebRTC.

1. Click the share button in the top-right panel
2. Share the generated link (`app.openpencil.dev/share/<room-id>`)
3. Collaborators see your cursor, selection, and edits in real time
4. Click a peer's avatar to follow their viewport

All sync happens peer-to-peer via [Trystero](https://github.com/dmotz/trystero). Document state is persisted locally in IndexedDB — refreshing the page keeps your work.

## CLI

Headless .fig file operations — no GUI needed:

```sh
bun open-pencil info design.fig         # Document stats, node types, fonts
bun open-pencil tree design.fig         # Visual node tree
bun open-pencil find design.fig --type TEXT  # Search by name or type
bun open-pencil export design.fig       # Render to PNG
bun open-pencil export design.fig -f jpg -s 2 -q 90  # JPG at 2x
```

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun run dev` | Dev server at http://localhost:1420 |
| `bun run build` | Production build |
| `bun run check` | Lint + typecheck |
| `bun run test` | E2E visual regression |
| `bun run test:update` | Regenerate screenshot baselines |
| `bun run test:unit` | Unit tests |
| `bun run tauri dev` | Desktop app (requires Rust) |

## Desktop App

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), the Tauri CLI, and platform-specific prerequisites ([Tauri v2 guide](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)).

```sh
bun run tauri dev                      # Dev mode with hot reload
bun run tauri build                    # Production build
bun run tauri build --target universal-apple-darwin  # macOS universal
```

Cross-compilation to other platforms requires their respective toolchains or CI (e.g. GitHub Actions).

### Platform Prerequisites

#### macOS

Install Xcode Command Line Tools:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

#### Windows

1. Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) — make sure the default toolchain is `stable-msvc`:
   ```sh
   rustup default stable-msvc
   ```
2. Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) with the "Desktop development with C++" workload (MSVC compiler + Windows SDK)
3. WebView2 is pre-installed on Windows 10 (1803+) and Windows 11. If missing, download from [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)

#### Linux

Install system dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu):

```sh
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential curl wget file \
  libxdo-dev libssl-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
```

For other distros, see the [Tauri v2 prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).
